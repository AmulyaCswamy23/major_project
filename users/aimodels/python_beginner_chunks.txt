In addition, the community develops many other libraries for Python. Ex: Pandas(https://openstax.org/r/100pandas)is a widely used library for data analysis. Another reason why Python is popular is because the syntax is concise and straightforward. Thesyntaxof a language defines how code must be structured. Syntax rules define the keywords, symbols, and formatting used in programs.

• Correct syntax errors, name errors, and indentation errors. How to read errors A natural part of programming is making mistakes. Even experienced programmers make mistakes when writing code. Errors may result when mistakes are made when writing code. The computer requires very specific instructions telling the computer what to do. If the instructions are not clear, then the computer does not know what to do and gives back an error. When an error occurs, Python displays a message with the following information: 1. The line number of the error. 2. The type of error (Ex:SyntaxError). 3.
Errors may result when mistakes are made when writing code. The computer requires very specific instructions telling the computer what to do.

In Python, parentheses are required to use print.
When an error occurs, Python displays a message with the following information: 1. The line number of the error. 2. The type of error (Ex:SyntaxError). 3. Additional details about the error. Ex: Typingprint "Hello!"without parentheses is a syntax error. In Python, parentheses are required to use print. When attempting to runprint "Hello!", Python displays the following error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/student/Desktop/example.py", line 1 print "Hello" ^ SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello")?

When attempting to runprint "Hello!", Python displays the following error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/student/Desktop/example.py", line 1 print "Hello" ^ SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello")? The caret character (^) shows where Python found the error.

When attempting to runprint "Hello!", Python displays the following error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/student/Desktop/example.py", line 1 print "Hello" ^ SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello")? The caret character (^) shows where Python found the error. Sometimes the error may be located one or two lines before where the caret symbol is shown because Python may not have discovered the error until then.

Python provides two ways to write multi-line statements: • Explicit line joining, using\characters: decl = "The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of " \ "America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes " \ "necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands..." • Implicit line joining, using parentheses: decl = ("The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of " "America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes " "necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands...") Implicit line joining is more common, since many statements and expressions use parentheses anyway. PEP 8 recommends avoiding the use of explicit line joining whenever possible. CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE Multi-line statements 8. Which character is used for explicit line joining?

Ex: The stringf"Good morning, {first} {last}!" has two replacement fields: one for a first name, and one for a last name. F-strings provide a convenient way to combine multiple values into one string.

Aforloop is a preferable option in cases where a loop is used for counting purposes using arange()function, or when iterating over a container object, including nested situations. Ex: Iterating over multiple course rosters. The outer loop iterates over different courses, and the inner loop iterates over the names in each course roster.

A function's changes to the object then appear outside the function. Animmutableobject cannot be modified after creation. So a function must make a local copy to modify, and the local copy's changes don't appear outside the function. Programmers should be cautious of modifying function arguments as these side effects can make programs difficult to debug and maintain.

In the given syntax, • Theindexfield refers to the index of the argument. • Thewidthfield refers to the minimum length of the string. • Theprecisionfield refers to the floating-point precision of the given number. • Thetypefield shows the type of the input that is passed to theformat()method. Floating-point and decimal inputs are identified by"f"and"d", respectively.

Likewise,fruit["NANA"]raises aKeyErrorbecause"nana"does not exactly match"banana". Implement thelookup()function. This function tries to find a key in the dictionary that matches the search term. A key matches if the search term is a substring of the key, ignoring case. Ex: The key "banana"matches the search term"NANA". If no matching keys are found,lookup()should raise aKeyErrorwith the message"search term not found".
